**`NLP HomeBrewer (AI/NaturalLanguages/CoffeeBeans)`**

I am a Costa Rican computational linguist and developer specializing in deploying AI/ML tools for discourse studies, low resource language research, and political discourse understanding. All of my coding projects have a social responsibility tenet, as I plan, design, and solve real-life problems that impact communities and individuals. I am a firm believer in language and technology as a means to empower people and strengthen human relationships in the building of an ideal world. I always code with amazing coffee on my desk!
