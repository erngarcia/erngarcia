**`Applied Scientist | NLP HomeBrewer | AI & Language Explorer`**  

I am a Costa Rican Applied Scientist with a background in **NLP, AI/ML, and linguistics**, passionate about deploying AI systems that bridge communication gaps—whether in translation, spoken language processing, or language simplification. My work focuses on real-world applications, from low-resource language research to decision systems for AI deployment.  

Beyond NLP, I love exploring time series forecasting, AI for agriculture, and financial modeling, always looking for ways to **blend data-driven insights with social impact**.  

For me, **technology is a tool for empowerment**, whether it’s making language accessible or predicting coffee harvests. When I’m not coding, I’m probably climbing, sketching out van conversion plans, reading, or brewing an amazing cup of coffee.

Always open to collaborations on **NLP, AI applications, or just a great conversation over coffee.**
