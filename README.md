**`Applied Scientist | NLP HomeBrewer | AI & Language Explorer`**  

I am a Costa Rican **Applied Scientist** with a background in **NLP, AI/ML, and linguistics**, passionate about **deploying AI systems that bridge communication gaps**â€”whether in translation, spoken language processing, or legal language simplification. My work focuses on **real-world applications**, from **low-resource language research** to **decision systems for AI deployment**.  

Beyond NLP, I love exploring **time series forecasting, AI for agriculture, and financial modeling**, always looking for ways to **blend data-driven insights with social impact**.  

I believe in **technology as a tool for empowerment**, whether itâ€™s making legal language accessible or predicting coffee harvests. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably **climbing, sketching out van conversion plans, reading fragmented literature, or brewing an amazing cup of coffee.**  

ðŸš€ Always open to collaborations on **NLP, AI applications, or just a great conversation over coffee.**
